Summarize this dialog:
A: Hi Tom, are you busy tomorrow’s afternoon?
B: I’m pretty sure I am. What’s up?
A: Can you go with me to the animal shelter?.
B: What do you want to do?
A: I want to get a puppy for my son.
B: That will make him so happy.
A: Yeah, we’ve discussed it many times. I think he’s ready now.
B: That’s good. Raising a dog is a tough issue. Like having a baby ;-)
A: I'll get him one of those little dogs.
B: One that won't grow up too big;-)
A: And eat too much;-))
B: Do you know which one he would like?
A: Oh, yes, I took him there last Monday. He showed me one that he really liked.
B: I bet you had to drag him away.
A: He wanted to take it home right away ;-).
B: I wonder what he'll name it.
A: He said he’d name it after his dead hamster – Lemmy  - he's  a great Motorhead fan :-)))
